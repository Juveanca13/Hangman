## Description

The "Hangman" is a simple Python console game where the user is prompted to guess a letter, and the program checks if the guessed letter is in a randomly chosen secret word. The aim of the project is to demonstrate basic Python programming concepts such as loops, functions, and input validation.

## Installation

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Juveanca13/hangman498.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd hangman-game

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python hangman.py


## Usage
1. Upon running the game, you will be prompted to guess a letter.
2. Enter a single character as your guess.
3. The game will display the current state of the word with underscores for unguessed letters.
4. Continue guessing until you either complete the word or run out of lives.


## File structure
