## Description

The "Hangman" is a simple Python console game where the user is prompted to guess a letter, and the program checks if the guessed letter is in a randomly chosen secret word. The aim of the project is to demonstrate basic Python programming concepts such as loops, functions, and input validation.

## Installation

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Juveanca13/hangman498.git

## Usage
Enter a single letter when prompted.
The program will inform you whether the letter is in the word or not.
Keep guessing until you find the correct letters to complete the word.
